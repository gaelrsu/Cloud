# WAF

## Intro
```
AWS WAF, or Amazon Web Services Web Application Firewall, is a firewall service that helps protect web applications from common web exploits and attacks.
It allows you to control which traffic to allow or block to your web applications by defining customizable web security rules.
These rules are designed to filter out malicious traffic, such as SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks,
before it reaches your web applications running on AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances or Amazon API Gateway.
